# WHAT IS SPORTAKUS?
Sportakus is a front-end project for DigitalCrafts utilizing everything we've learned so far. We had one week to finish our Sports Matches and Tickets application. Our project will be a sort of sports aggragator that pulls:
* Map of where current matches are held
* Options to buy tickets
* Historical data of past matches

Our learning objectives included:
* Working together as a team, practice effective communications via explicit documentation through Github
* Scrum agile methodology implemented via daily scrum meetings and scrum board to track our progress

# TEAM CONTRIBUTIONS

# OBSTACLES
Due to the limitations of the API's used, we could only make so few calls to pull information from their databases. So, as a workaround, we downloaded their databases as a JSON file and made calls "locally" anytime we needed ticket information (who's playing, what stadium, location, etc).

# NEXT STEPS
* Dynamic data pulls from assorted API's (this can be accomplished on paid accounts for API services)
* Add more sports to app
* Add login functionality to remember user ticket/sports preferences
* Add news feed carousel at the bottom, can be accomplished using Bing API
