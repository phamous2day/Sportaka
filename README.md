# Sportakus
A front-end project for DigitalCrafts utilizing everything we've learned so far. We had one week to finish our Sports Matches and Tickets application. Our learning objectives include:

* Working together as a team, practice effective communications via explicit documentation through Github
* Scrum agile methodology implemented via daily scrum meetings and scrum board to track our progress

# Technologies, Frameworks, and Programming Languages used

Languages:
* HTML5, 
* CSS3, 
* JavaScript
* AngularJS

API's
* Sports Radar API 
* Ticketmaster API
* Google Maps API

Additional Tools:

# Obstacles
Due to the limitations of the API's used, we could only make so few calls to pull information from their databases. So, as a workaround, we downloaded their databases as a JSON file and made calls "locally" anytime we needed ticket information (who's playing, what stadium, location, etc).

# Next Steps
* Dynamic data pulls from assorted API's (this can be accomplished on paid accounts for API services)
* Add more sports to app
* Add login functionality to remember user ticket/sports preferences
* Add news feed carousel at the bottom, can be accomplished using Bing API
